    <h1>Death</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1 - Introduction</h2>

      <h3 class="subtitle">The Forgotten Story</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Once upon a time, long before anyone could remember, a tiny world
        existed.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Everything was cold in this lonely world. The stars stopped moving, the
        planets stopped rotating, the sun stopped shining. Everything felt like
        it had lost all of its hope. Everything just wanted to die.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        There were only two beings left in this plane of existence, filled with
        boredom, looking at the never moving sky in the night.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>"Tell me a story!" - said one spirit to the other.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The other spirit, hearing those words felt happy. Something he had never
        felt for a while.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>He started his story...&nbsp;</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        “I am going to tell you a story that even time itself may have
        forgotten. This is the story of the people whose footsteps have long
        been vanished. This is the story of our people.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        At that time not many people had been born into this world, but those
        who did surely had wished they hadn't. Every man and woman was given
        what they thought at first to be a blessing, but later considered it to
        be the most evil curse a God could give them. They were given
        immortality.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        &nbsp;For the first aeons, everybody was happy and life was prospering,
        they had never seen death, they had never lost someone they loved, they
        did not even know that death existed. That may have been the only true
        blessing they ever had, living without crying for those who left their
        world without saying goodbye.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        There was only one entity that knew how death felt like, for he was the
        only one who could bring it. Some people described him as being a pale
        man with dark hair, often holding an axe in his right hand. He was a
        mysterious being, not much was known of him and neither people wanted
        to.
      </p>
      <h3 class="subtitle">The Marble Temple</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Eohm was the capital of this tiny world. In it, there was a giant white
        temple, made out of marble, with columns surrounding the walls, much
        like one of those greek ruins.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The sunrays made the temple shine with incredible beauty, stealing the
        spotlight in everyone’s sight, it was a magnet for the eyes. But the
        true beauty lied inside.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        To enter, you had to go through one of the nine pair of doors
        surrounding it, three doors on each side, apart from the back, which had
        none. The doors were about 4 meters tall and 2 meters wide each. They
        were made out of an incredible strong metal that was very light in
        weight, but so dense that no particle of light could pass through it.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Therefore, the inside of the temple was purely dark if no internal
        source of light was involved.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>And yet, there was light.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Sixteen torches surrounded the four walls, four on each side. Those
        torches were quite mind-bogglind, they never stopped burning, their
        fire, forever shining from its ashes. It was so beautiful to look at.
        But the torches light didn’t light up the entire temple, the middle was
        still dark.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The temple was quite immense on the inside, and yet it was not empty at
        all.
      </p>
      <h3 class="subtitle">Four Walls</h3>
      <hr />

      <p>
        The forever-burning torches in the temple revealed mysterious paintings
        on the walls, feeling almost as if they were sacred. Who could have
        painted those masterpieces, so perfect, yet so intriguing?
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        On each wall, you could see a story, each one being some sort of
        continuation of the previous one.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        If you’d place yourself in the middle of the temple and make a full
        turn, you would see a cycle of an eternal story, always ending, always
        starting again, as if nothing happened.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        It felt like it described a cycle of creation that could not be broken,
        even if someone wanted to. As if the Creator’s hands were tied to follow
        this cycle, as if he himself was cursed, with no choice.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The wall opposite to the main entrance was painted with dark colours,
        close to black but with some drops of red. No human figures were present
        on any of the four walls, just colours and feelings.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The walls were painted with feelings. Feelings so powerful they could be
        materialized.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        This first wall injected a feeling of agony and despair inside the
        seeker’s eyes. It would leave him with a sense of hopelessness, sadness,
        as if everything was lost, as if everything had no meaning, no value.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Looking at your left, you’d see the next wall in the temple’s cycle.
        Every wall was connected to its neighbours, the paintings, bounded,
        their colours, their feelings, were spread on the adjacent ones.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        This wall had lighter colours, like a rise from the ashes from the
        previous one. It was painted in red, green and blue, the primary colours
        from which anything could be created. This painting left the feeling of
        hope, of creation, of a new beginning. A rise from the ashes in which it
        was burning in before.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The wall where the main entrance was situated, from which every human
        would enter, was painted with warm and light colours, such as orange and
        yellow. This painting left a feeling of curiosity, of joy, of discovery.
        Anybody that would have looked at this painting would be filled with a
        feeling of wanting to explore the temple, to know more, to know how
        things worked.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        This represented the joy the Creator must have felt while carefully
        putting together His masterpiece.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Looking at your right felt like looking into the future. The painting on
        the last wall was filled with red, the colour of fury. This painting
        represented anger, destruction, regret. It felt like a terrible ending
        to something so beautiful. An evitable ending. Nothing could stop time,
        not love, not fury, not even the Creator.
