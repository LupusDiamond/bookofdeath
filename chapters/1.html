      <h3 class="subtitle">The Forgotten Story</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Once upon a time, long before anyone could remember, our world was very
        different.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Everything was cold in our world. The stars stopped moving, the planets
        stopped rotating, the sun stopped shining. Everything felt like it had
        lost all of its hope. Everything just wanted to die.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        There were only two beings left in this plane of existence, filled with
        boredom, looking at the never moving sky in the night.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>"Tell me a story!" - said one spirit to the other.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The other spirit, hearing those words felt happy. Something he had never
        felt for a while.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>He started his story...</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        “I am going to tell you a story that even time itself may have
        forgotten. This is the story of the people whose footsteps have long
        been vanished. This is the story of our people.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Going down from the stars, from all of the sky’s terror, tearing through
        the clouds, you’d finally see the beautiful city of Eohm, the capital of
        this entire planet. The capital was home for more than twenty billion
        people, it was immense, and yet, it was built so carefully.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The civilians had no need to be in a rush, they had all the time in the
        world, quite literally. Their immortality made them precise workers, but
        made their life incredibly boring.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        After living for so much time, they had lost all interest in everything,
        from creation, from love and from hate. What was the point in seeking
        the mystery of an afterlife if their life would never end?
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        They felt like their life had no meaning. Things were just repeating all
        over and over again in front of their eyes. People being born, growing
        up and then leaving to go to work, all of this for hundreds of thousands
        of generations. What was the point of being born in this meaningless
        world?&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Just to live? For what?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        For this reason, people slowly stopped procreating, thinking it would be
        immoral to bring any new life on this miserable world. And for many
        other aeons, no child was ever seen running around the city’s square, or
        anywhere else in the world.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        That is, until Yin came into life. The last child born in this
        meaningless suffering.
      </p>
      <h3 class="subtitle">The Marble Temple</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Eohm was the capital of our world. In it, there was a giant white
        temple, made out of marble, with columns surrounding the walls, much
        like one of those greek ruins.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The sunrays made the temple shine with incredible beauty, stealing the
        spotlight in everyone’s sight, it was a magnet for the eyes. But the
        true beauty lied inside.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        To enter, you had to go through one of the nine pair of doors
        surrounding it, three doors on each side, apart from the back, which had
        none. The doors were about 4 meters tall and 2 meters wide each. They
        were made out of an incredible strong metal that was very light in
        weight, but so dense that no particle of light could pass through it.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Therefore, the inside of the temple was purely dark if no internal
        source of light was involved.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>And yet, there was light.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Sixteen torches surrounded the four walls, four on each side. Those
        torches were quite mind-bogglind, they never stopped burning, their
        fire, forever shining from its ashes. It was so beautiful to look at.
        But the torches light didn’t light up the entire temple, the middle was
        still dark.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The temple was quite immense on the inside, and yet it was not empty at
        all.
      </p>
      <h3 class="subtitle">Four Walls</h3>
      <hr />

      <p>
        The forever-burning torches in the temple revealed mysterious paintings
        on the walls, feeling almost as if they were sacred. Who could have
        painted those masterpieces, so perfect, yet so intriguing?
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        On each wall, you could see a story, each one being some sort of
        continuation of the previous one.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        If you’d place yourself in the middle of the temple and make a full
        turn, you would see a cycle of an eternal story, always ending, always
        starting again, as if nothing happened.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        It felt like it described a cycle of creation that could not be broken,
        even if someone wanted to. As if the Creator’s hands were tied to follow
        this cycle, as if he himself was cursed, with no choice.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The wall opposite to the main entrance was painted with dark colours,
        close to black but with some drops of red. No human figures were present
        on any of the four walls, just colours and feelings.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The walls were painted with feelings. Feelings so powerful they could be
        materialized.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        This first wall injected a feeling of agony and despair inside the
        seeker’s eyes. It would leave him with a sense of hopelessness, sadness,
        as if everything was lost, as if everything had no meaning, no value.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Looking at your left, you’d see the next wall in the temple’s cycle.
        Every wall was connected to its neighbours, the paintings, bounded,
        their colours, their feelings, were spread on the adjacent ones.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        This wall had lighter colours, like a rise from the ashes from the
        previous one. It was painted in red, green and blue, the primary colours
        from which anything could be created. This painting left the feeling of
        hope, of creation, of a new beginning. A rise from the ashes in which it
        was burning in before.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The wall where the main entrance was situated, from which every human
        would enter, was painted with warm and light colours, such as orange and
        yellow. This painting left a feeling of curiosity, of joy, of discovery.
        Anybody that would have looked at this painting would be filled with a
        feeling of wanting to explore the temple, to know more, to know how
        things worked.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        This represented the joy the Creator must have felt while carefully
        putting together His masterpiece.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Looking at your right felt like looking into the future. The painting on
        the last wall was filled with red, the colour of fury. This painting
        represented anger, destruction, regret. It felt like a terrible ending
        to something so beautiful. An evitable ending. Nothing could stop time,
        not love, not fury, not even the Creator.
