    <h2>Chapter 1 - Four Walls</h2>
    <hr />
    <div class="ch-text">
      <p>
        The forever-burning torches in the temple revealed mysterious paintings
        on the walls, feeling almost as if they were sacred. Who could have
        painted those masterpieces, so perfect, yet so intriguing?
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        On each wall, you could see a story, each one being some sort of
        continuation of the previous one.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        If you’d place yourself in the middle of the temple and make a full
        turn, you would see a cycle of an eternal story, always ending, always
        starting again, as if nothing happened.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        It felt like it described a cycle of creation that could not be broken,
        even if someone wanted to. As if the Creator’s hands were tied to follow
        this cycle, as if he himself was cursed, with no choice.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The wall opposite to the main entrance was painted with dark colours,
        close to black but with some drops of red. No human figures were present
        on any of the four walls, just colours and feelings.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The walls were painted with feelings. Feelings so powerful they could be
        materialized.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        This first wall injected a feeling of agony and despair inside the
        seeker’s eyes. It would leave him with a sense of hopelessness, sadness,
        as if everything was lost, as if everything had no meaning, no value.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Looking at your left, you’d see the next wall in the temple’s cycle.
        Every wall was connected to its neighbours, the paintings, bounded,
        their colours, their feelings, were spread on the adjacent ones.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        This wall had lighter colours, like a rise from the ashes from the
        previous one. It was painted in red, green and blue, the primary colours
        from which anything could be created. This painting left the feeling of
        hope, of creation, of a new beginning. A rise from the ashes in which it
        was burning in before.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        The wall where the main entrance was situated, from which every human
        would enter, was painted with warm and light colours, such as orange and
        yellow. This painting left a feeling of curiosity, of joy, of discovery.
        Anybody that would have looked at this painting would be filled with a
        feeling of wanting to explore the temple, to know more, to know how
        things worked.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        This represented the joy the Creator must have felt while carefully
        putting together His masterpiece.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>
        Looking at your right felt like looking into the future. The painting on
        the last wall was filled with red, the colour of fury. This painting
        represented anger, destruction, regret. It felt like a terrible ending
        to something so beautiful. An evitable ending. Nothing could stop time,
        not love, not fury, not even the Creator.
